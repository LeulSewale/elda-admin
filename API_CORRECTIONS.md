# ✅ API Endpoint Corrections Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. **Mark as Read - Changed to POST**
**Before:** `PATCH /notifications/:id/read`  
**After:** `POST /notifications/:id/read`  
**File:** `lib/api/notifications.ts`

```typescript
// Changed from:
markAsRead: (id: string) => api.patch(`/notifications/${id}/read`)

// To:
markAsRead: (id: string) => api.post(`/notifications/${id}/read`)
```

### 2. **Mark All as Read - Changed to POST**
**Before:** `PATCH /notifications/read-all`  
**After:** `POST /notifications/read-all`  
**File:** `lib/api/notifications.ts`

```typescript
// Changed from:
markAllAsRead: () => api.patch("/notifications/read-all")

// To:
markAllAsRead: () => api.post("/notifications/read-all")
```

### 3. **Unread Count Response - Updated Field Name**
**Before:** Response field `count`  
**After:** Response field `unread`  
**File:** `hooks/use-notifications.tsx`

**Backend Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "unread": 1
  }
}
```

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Changed from:
const count = response.data?.data?.count || response.data?.count || 0

// To:
const count = response.data?.data?.unread || 0
```

## Updated API Endpoints Summary

### Complete List of Endpoints
```
GET    /notifications?limit=20&offset=0     → Fetch notifications with pagination
GET    /notifications/stream                → SSE connection for real-time updates
POST   /notifications/:id/read              → Mark a specific notification as read
POST   /notifications/read-all              → Mark all notifications as read
DELETE /notifications/:id                   → Delete a specific notification
GET    /notifications/unread-count          → Get count of unread notifications
```

## Testing the Corrected Endpoints

### Test Mark as Read (Single Notification)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://elda-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/notifications/NOTIFICATION_ID/read" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Test Mark All as Read
```bash
curl -X POST "https://elda-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/notifications/read-all" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Test Get Unread Count
```bash
curl -X GET "https://elda-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/notifications/unread-count" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "unread": 1
  }
}
```

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `lib/api/notifications.ts` - Changed HTTP methods to POST
2. ✅ `hooks/use-notifications.tsx` - Updated response parsing for unread count
3. ✅ `NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated documentation
4. ✅ `TESTING_NOTIFICATIONS.md` - Updated test examples
5. ✅ `NOTIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated endpoint references

## What Works Now

- ✅ Mark individual notification as read using POST
- ✅ Mark all notifications as read using POST
- ✅ Get unread count with correct field name `unread`
- ✅ All endpoints match your backend exactly
- ✅ No linter errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser console** and verify:
   - SSE connection establishes
   - Notifications load correctly
   - Mark as read works
   - Unread count updates properly

3. **Click a notification** and verify:
   - It marks as read
   - Navigates to the link
   - Unread count decrements

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] SSE connects on login (`[SSE] Connection opened` in console)
- [ ] Notifications list loads correctly
- [ ] Unread count shows correct number
- [ ] Clicking notification marks it as read (POST request in Network tab)
- [ ] "Mark All Read" button works (POST request in Network tab)
- [ ] Unread badge decrements when marking as read
- [ ] Real-time notifications appear via SSE
- [ ] Toast notifications show for new notifications
